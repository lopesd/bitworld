~DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#Tutorial 2
#In this area, three 'cycles' define
#a 'period', and you can move one
#square per cycle.
#
#A gate's weight determines how many
#bit-cycles within a period are 
#needed to open it. A counter
#indicates how much is left. 
#
#The gate on the right has a 
#weight of 3. If you visit it
#for all 3 cycles of a period,
#it will open.
