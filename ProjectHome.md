Bitworld is a 2D Turn-Based Strategy game set in a computer-themed world.  It incorporates these ‘digital world’ concepts as well as concepts from biology (specifically the immune system). The units on the grid are ‘bits’, and the user begins the game controlling a ‘viral’ bit whose objective is to bypass antivirus software (controlled by AI) and infect the computer. Along the way, the user may ‘corrupt’ and control normal worker bits and use them to do his or her bidding. The game will incorporate problem solving elements.

Bitworld is being developed in C++ by team "#include
